Read through what team did and make sure you fully understand it.
Read through the example and start generating ideas for each section of the presentation.
Start creating visuals based on above ideas.
Re-Think this list.




IDEAS:

DataCleaning
- Alex add more comments to the data cleaning, I have no idea what is going on.
- It looks like you are splitting the city and state... so why did we have to redo this in the geoplotting?
- In cell 12, I thought we were supposed to see the city split?
- The function to check for nans and fill them with population data is very readable. Comments make it clean.
- Now I see that we have 51 nulls in our population data... We'll have to determine if that affects our analysis but I don't think it will.
        I don't think it will because the S&P 500 companies are likely in cities with well recorded population statistics.

- Could you explain why we are creating another CSV with the nans removed?


fear_greed
- What is this API?
- Comments are easy to follow, clean flow.
- Maybe we can break it up?
- Breaking each piece up and showing the result makes it easy for me to follow, someone who didn't initially code it. However, is that necessary?
- What is the 'value' column and why are we dividing it by 100?
- Graph looks good. Don't we just want data for 2022?
- DATA ANALYSIS: 
    - Plot bitcoin fear/greed versus SnP returns?
    - Can we get the snp fear/greed easily to see those against SnP returns as well?
    - Other ideas for analysis?

snp500_pop_visualization
- So we are graphing each by sector... ok
- Creating a function is a nice idea. Makes the loop very easy.
    Maybe you could explain it a bit more? I need to work on my function creating.
    I understand all the plotting... except for the plt.bar(sector_data['security'])...
- Let's try to make the plot more readable... Maybe 45 degree rotation on x-axis.. I see that doing so looks bad initially...
    maybe we can do some resizing to clean it up.
- I like the exponential notaion for the Y.
- Oh I see by the title of the first plots, we are taking all companies in one sector, so the first one is "Industrials Sector".
    Then we are saying "what's the population of the city where that company HQ is located", and plotting that against the company. Niceeee.
- Ok, this is cool, but this amount of graphs seems extensive.
- Maybe we can keep a few of these... maybe pick out the most interesting sectors in our opinion...
    Then we can make a plot that shows the population given sector? 
    My predictions is that the tech/financial sectors will be located in the highest populated cities
- Next plot would be to combine this data with SnP500 returns to see if location (categorized by population) has an effect on returns...
    LET ME GET ON GENERATING THOSE DAILY PERCENT RETURNS...
