IDEAS:

DataCleaning
- Alex add more comments to the data cleaning, I have no idea what is going on.
- It looks like you are splitting the city and state... so why did we have to redo this in the geoplotting?
- In cell 12, I thought we were supposed to see the city split?
- The function to check for nans and fill them with population data is very readable. Comments make it clean.
- Now I see that we have 51 nulls in our population data... We'll have to determine if that affects our analysis but I don't think it will.
        I don't think it will because the S&P 500 companies are likely in cities with well recorded population statistics.

- Could you explain why we are creating another CSV with the nans removed?


fear_greed
- What is this API?
- Comments are easy to follow, clean flow.
- Maybe we can break it up?
- Breaking each piece up and showing the result makes it easy for me to follow, someone who didn't initially code it. However, is that necessary?
- What is the 'value' column and why are we dividing it by 100?
- Graph looks good. Don't we just want data for 2022?
- DATA ANALYSIS: 
    - Plot bitcoin fear/greed versus SnP returns?
    - Can we get the snp fear/greed easily to see those against SnP returns as well?
    - Other ideas for analysis?
